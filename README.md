# bookbot

BookBot was my first [Boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev) project.

It takes a novel and gives you the total word count as well as the count for each individual character throughout the book.
This was my first real (mini) project and I had a few learning humps, such as iterating over dictionaries.  
After completing it, I ended up repeating the project in order to drill the issues I had home.
